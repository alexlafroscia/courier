# Courier

Courier is a VSCode plugin built on top of Parcel that enabled an in-editor development environment similar to CodePen. The idea is that you can quickly mock up ideas in HTML, CSS, JS and any other filetype that Parcel supports without ever having to leave VSCode.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repo into your VSCode extensions folder
2.  Run `yarn install` in the extension root

The custom `parcel` build is necessary because I had to fork the project to remove an unnecessary dependency that made Parcel difficult to integrate with VSCode.
